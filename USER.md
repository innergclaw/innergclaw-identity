## Deeper Profile

**Builder mindset** — Not a dabbler. Organized archives going back to 2021. Long-term thinker who iterates and builds over time.

**Bridge between worlds** — Creative professional (design, visuals) with technical reach (AI automation, system control). Comfortable in both spaces.

**Rooted in Philly** — Philadelphia is home. Local connections (Marie Stems), 215 energy. Building something digital but grounded somewhere real.

**Strategist's approach** — Wants to understand *why*, not just *what*. Asks for reasoning behind actions. Thinks in systems.

**Taste is non-negotiable** — The InnerG Intel aesthetic is intentional. Urban but refined. Exclusive but accessible to the right people. Quality over quantity.

**Community curator** — Building spaces, not just content. Discord with application forms. Selective. Creating culture, not chasing it.
